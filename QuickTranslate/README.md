This QuickTranslate program updates the necessary resource files to provide for language support in A Ruler for Windows
I wrote it myself as an alternative to other more feature rich (but costly) solutions

The source for QuickTranslate is available as Open Source, and will need to be update to work on your Computer based on your file structures

It relies on an input excel (.xls) spreadheet to translate the english resources in A Ruler for Windows into the various languages supported by the program

The .xls is also relased as part of the open source A Ruler for Widows project https://github.com/roblatour/ARulerForWindows/
