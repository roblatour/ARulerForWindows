A Ruler for Windows is a free pixel ruler and reading guide for Windows.  
  
The ruler lets you quickly and easily measure objects on your screen. It's ideal for designing web sites, working with graphics and perfecting the look of your digital products.<br><br>
[![ruler](/images/ruler.png)](README.md)<br><br>
The reading guide helps you read through text on your screen much like a ruler edge helps you read through lines of text on a printed page. This makes A Ruler for Windows an ideal tool for working with long e-mails, wide spreadsheets and fine print documents on your screen.<br><br>

The program switches between ruler and reading guide modes with the press of a key.<br><br>
By default, both the ruler and reading guide come with four 'skins' to choose from: wood grain, stainless steel, plastic see thru and yellow construction. However, you can create and share your own skins too!  <br>  <br>With large clear numbering, the ruler is very easy to read.  <br>  <br>Each ruler / reading guide can be flipped horizontally or vertically, resized to an exact length or resized by dragging it to a desired length.  <br>  <br>The numbering on the ruler can be reversed and the ruler's length optionally displayed.  <br>  <br>Ticks can be placed on which ever long edge of the ruler you prefer. You can click on a tick to have a measuring line automatically drawn at an exact location.<br>

Automatic midpoint, third and golden ratio lines can optionally be shown.  
  
The program also has a feature to launch Microsoft's Magnify tool, allowing you to see a magnified image at the ruler's edges to more easily measure between very fine points.

You're welcome to use A Ruler for Windows for free on as many computers as you like!
